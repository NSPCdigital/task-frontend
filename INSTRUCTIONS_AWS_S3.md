# Instructions: Uploading Files to AWS S3 in task-frontend

## 1. FileUpload Component
The `src/components/FileUpload.js` component allows users to upload files to an AWS S3 bucket. There are two main approaches:

- **AWS SDK (not recommended for frontend production):** Requires AWS credentials in the frontend code. Use only for local testing.
- **Presigned URL (recommended):** Secure and best practice. The frontend uploads files directly to S3 using a presigned URL generated by your backend.

## 2. Recommended Setup (Presigned URL)
1. **Backend:**
   - Create an endpoint in your backend that generates a presigned URL for uploading a file to your S3 bucket.
   - Example (Node.js, AWS SDK):
     ```js
     const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
     const s3 = new AWS.S3({ region: 'YOUR_REGION' });
     app.get('/presign', (req, res) => {
       const params = {
         Bucket: 'YOUR_BUCKET',
         Key: req.query.filename,
         Expires: 60, // seconds
         ContentType: req.query.contentType
       };
       s3.getSignedUrl('putObject', params, (err, url) => {
         res.json({ url });
       });
     });
     ```
2. **Frontend:**
   - Fetch the presigned URL from your backend and use it in the FileUpload component:
     ```js
     // Example fetch
     const res = await fetch(`/presign?filename=${file.name}&contentType=${file.type}`);
     const { url } = await res.json();
     // Then upload
     await fetch(url, { method: 'PUT', body: file, headers: { 'Content-Type': file.type } });
     ```
   - See comments in `FileUpload.js` for details.

## 3. Local Testing
- You can generate a presigned URL using AWS CLI:
  ```sh
  aws s3 presign s3://YOUR_BUCKET/FILE_NAME --region YOUR_REGION --expires-in 600
  ```
- Paste this URL into the code for quick tests.

## 4. Security Warning
**Never store AWS credentials in frontend production code!** Always use presigned URLs generated by a secure backend.

## 5. Usage
- The FileUpload component is already included in the Dashboard view.
- Configure your AWS details or presigned URL as described above.
